These scripts and example configurations are to help use Farsight's
Newly-Observed Domains (NOD) service.

nod-rsync.py and nod-rsync.sh are used to manage rsync of data files for
the NOD service.  The former runs as a service and the latter is meant to be
run by cron.

Both scripts load configuration data from /etc/nod-rsync.conf,
~/.nod-rsync.conf or from environment variables.  The configuration is 
a set of key=value pairs, one per line.  All configuration options may be
overridden in the python program with command-line options.

Both scripts require the following options to be set:

RSYNC_HOST - the hostname or service name of the rsync server
REMOTE_PATH - the remote path on the rsync server to synchronize
TARGET - the local path that rsync writes to

The following optional variables may also be set:

KNOWN_HOSTS_URL - defaults to https://dl.farsightsecurity.com/....
USER - the user on the rsync server
SSH_IDENTITY - overrides the ssh identity file
SSH_ARGS - any extra arguments to ssh
PORT - Override the port to connect to via ssh (default 49222)
RSYNC - path to the rsync binary
WRAPSRV - path to the wrapsrv binary
SSH - path to the ssh binary

The python script allows some extra options to be set:

PERIOD - How often to run rsync, in seconds.
LOG_FILE - Log to file instead of stderr.  Required for daemon mode.
PID_FILE - Pid file for daemon mode.
